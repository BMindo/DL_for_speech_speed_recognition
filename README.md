# DL_for_speech_speed_recognition

The idea is to investigate how LD could recognize the different speaking pace The data was collected from youtube videos, the video was of different length and from 5 different people for both classes: 100 words per min and 150 words per min. Each of videos were converted to audio files and split to 5 second files.

# Context:
Total number of files: 600

Length of one fie: 5 s

number of classes: 2 (100 wpm and 150 wpm)

# Goal:
To build a DL model testing few architectures to predict the speed of human speech.
